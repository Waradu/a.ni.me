## ü§® A‚Ä¢NI‚Ä¢ME? what is this?

A‚Ä¢NI‚Ä¢ME helps you keep track of all the anime you‚Äôve watched. It‚Äôs simple, fast, and easy to use! You can sort and filter your list, share it with friends.

You can also hide shows you don‚Äôt want others to see üòè. Soon, you‚Äôll be able to sync your list across devices and get cool recommendations! It‚Äôs perfect for any anime fan who watches a lot!

<sup>why A‚Ä¢NI‚Ä¢ME? because "anime" in japanese means „Ç¢„Éã„É°</sup><br>
<sup><b>„Ç¢ = A, „Éã = NI, „É° = ME</b></sup>
